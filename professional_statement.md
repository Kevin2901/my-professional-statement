Professional Statement

I am a cybersecurity-focused engineer with a Master’s in Computer Science (Cybersecurity specialization) and a Bachelor's in Mechatronics. Through a blend of formal education, hands-on internships, and self-directed learning, I have built a solid foundation in secure software development, network hardening, and risk mitigation.

During my academic journey I completed a one-month cybersecurity internship where I applied vulnerability assessment techniques in a real-world environment, and a three-month embedded systems internship, gaining hands-on experience with low-level hardware. To deepen my expertise, I earned the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and continuously sharpen my skills through platforms such as TryHackMe and LetsDefend.io.

My portfolio showcases a recurring, production grade Python project that automates the management of IP-allow-lists for privileged resources—a task that directly protects organizational assets from unauthorized access. Across multiple documented iterations of this project I have demonstrated:

* Secure file handling pipelines – opened, read, parsed, and rewrote sensitive configuration files using context managed (with) statements to guarantee resource cleanup and prevent file descriptor leaks.
* Robust data transformation – converted raw file contents to structured Python lists via .split(), applied conditional logic to filter out revoked IPs, and rebuilt the cleaned list with .join() for safe persistence.

* Error-aware logic – guarded removal operations with existence checks to avoid ValueErrors, ensuring the script never crashes in production.

* Automation \& repeatability – packaged the workflow into a reusable script that can be scheduled to keep access controls synchronized with a dynamic “remove list,” eliminating manual admin overhead.

* Documentation \& reporting – produced clear, step-by-step project reports that outline purpose, methodology, and outcomes, reflecting strong communication skills essential for audit and compliance roles.

Beyond technical work, I bring leadership and teamwork experience from playing football and motorcycling, where I learned to coordinate groups under pressure, make quick decisions, and maintain focus on safety—qualities that translate well to incident response and collaborative security initiatives.

I am now seeking a role where I can leverage my strong analytical foundation, hands-on project experience, and collaborative mindset to design and implement robust security solutions that protect critical assets and empower organizations to operate confidently in today’s threat landscape.
